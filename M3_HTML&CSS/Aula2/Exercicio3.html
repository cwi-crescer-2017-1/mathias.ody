                        Celebrate Wolfenstein 3D's 25th Birthday with Mods and Source Ports

                        First-person shooters existed before Wolfenstein 3D in the same way that platformers existed before Donkey Kong. Wolf3D cemented id's reputation as the foremost developer of FPS titles, giving programming wunderkind John Carmack the opportunity to crack his knuckles and expand on Hovertank 3-D and Catacomb 3D, Wolf's predecessors. </br>
                        Wolfenstein 3D, the grandfather of first-person shooters, turns 25 years old today. That silver anniversary is important not only within id's history, but the history of the industry at large. If, as a PC gamer, you look to the latest and greatest FPS to show off your new rig or upgraded parts, you've got Wolf3D to thank for setting that standard. Likewise, Wolf3D set the mold for FPS games that featured action at breakneck speeds.</br>
                        Equally important, Wolfenstein 3D established shareware, a method of software publishing popularized (although not invented) by Apogee founder Scott Miller, who partnered with id Software to release 2D platforming sensation Commander Keen before the tandem made even bigger waves with Wolf3D.</br>
                        If I'm being honest, Wolfenstein 3D doesn't have the same legs as Doom or Quake, its descendants. Its core, however—mowing down Nazis and introducing Adolph Hitler to the business end of your chaingun—remains a pleasant way to kill a Saturday afternoon. So why don't you do just that by using some of the mods and source ports of the game I've linked to below? And after you've done that—or before; you know, whenever—click "Visit Chatty to Join the Conversation" to share your memories of Wolfenstein 3D.</br>
                        Note that you'll need the full version of Wolfenstein 3D for most of these mods to work. You can get it for cheap on Steam ($4.99) and GOG.com ($9.99, a price that includes the sequel, Spear of Destiny) among other digital retailers.</br>

                        Godot 3.0 Alpha Coming Soon
                    </div>
                     <div class="subtitulo_noticia">
                       Work on Godot 3.0 as the next major update to this open-source cross-platform 2D/3D game engine is advancing with an alpha now in sight
                    </div>

                        Godot has now an experimental exporter to WebAssembly and WebGL2, thanks to eska's work. You need latest Chrome or Firefox to test it, but it works really well. It even runs games flawlessly on mobile web!</br>
                        We recently wrote an article about GDNative (initially named DLScript but renamed to avoid confusion). Let me tell you that this amazing new feature by Thomas Herzog (karroffel) and Bojidar Marinov (bojidar-bg) is the real deal.</br>
                        While we offer a default particles material (which is very powerful and customizable), it is possible to write your own particle logic entirely in a shader. It is also possible to convert a particle system to a shader and do further modifications to it by yourself, manually.</br>
                        With this, all major funtionalities planned for 3.0 are implemented. We will be releasing an alpha build soon for everyone to start playing with them and finding bugs. Stay tuned!</br>

                        A little explanation about BSP (Binary space partitioning)
                    </div>
                    <div class="corpo_noticia">
                        In computer science, binary space partitioning (BSP) is a method for recursively subdividing a space into convex sets by hyperplanes. This subdivision gives rise to a representation of objects within the space by means of a tree data structure known as a BSP tree.</br>
                        Binary space partitioning was developed in the context of 3D computer graphics, where the structure of a BSP tree allows spatial information about the objects in a scene that is useful in rendering, such as their ordering from front-to-back with respect to a viewer at a given location, to be accessed rapidly. Other applications include performing geometrical operations with shapes (constructive solid geometry) in CAD, collision detection in robotics and 3-D video games, ray tracing and other computer applications that involve handling of complex spatial scenes.</br>
